The data set I analyzed was a Netflix Titles data set.  What I did was use R to analyze the dataset, and what I chose to analyze was content type, country of origin, ratings,  and release year.  First, how I loaded the data set into R, I used the read_csv function from the Tidyverse package, but first I ran the code for the tidyverse, then the read_csv function, because the read_csv function does not exist until the tidyverse package is loaded. Then I use the glimpse() function to examine the structure of the data set. This helped me examine the data set better because it included the number of observations, variable names, and data types. After that then I use pipe operator (%>%). The use is to pass the Netflix data set through a sequence of data cleaning and summarization steps, with the final results stored in a new data set, which I called it movievsshows_count. Then kept analyzing the number of movies and TV shows on netflix and I calculated it by using function count(type), and the values in the type column. No missing values were removed for the step, and I chose that because the type variable contains complete information for all titles. As well, the results for that were movies on netflix was 6,131, and TV shows were 2,676.

After that, I made a list of which countries produce the most netflix content and did a top 10. Rows with missing country values are removed. I first used the pipe operator (%>%). Again, the use is to pass the netflix data set through a sequence of data cleaning and summarization steps, with the final results stored in a new data set, which I called it country_count. I use the filter()  function to keep only rows that meet the condition and that ones did not have missing country values, and the other function was !is.na(country), and I use this code because it means keep rows where country is not missing. Because some titles list multiple countries in a single cell, so these entries are split into separate rows to ensure each country is counted individually. Now, the results are sorted to identify the top producing countries. For the Results 1. United States: 3,689, 2. India: 1,046, 3. United Kingdom: 804, and after that, the results were about 450 or lower than for the last 7. 


This code here analyzes the distribution of netflix content ratings using the rating column. As well, similar to the code for which countries produce the most netflix content. We started with using the pipe operator and named it rate_count, then used the filter function, then used!is na to remove rows with where the ratings are missing and also filtered out incorrect entries that contain duration values like 66 min, for example. After cleaning the data, it counts how many titles fall into each valid rating category, such as TV-MA, PG-13, or TV-14. The results show that the top 3 were, number 1 TV-MA: 3,207, 2 TV-14: 2,160, 3 TV-PG: 863, and then after that last 11 ratings were 800 or less. Last thing I coded was a line chart and I use the ggplot2  package to make a visualization trend in netflix content over time. For year_count That data set is used where release_year  is on the x-axis and n( the number of titles release that year) is on the y-axis. Then I use the geom_line() function and that draws a line connecting the number of tiles for each year, and that shows me how content production has changed over time. The labs()  function adds a descriptive title and axis label to make the chart more easier to understand. The results show on line chart that there were very few titles before the 2000s, but there was a slow growth from 2000 to 2010, and then there was a good amount of increase after 2010, and that shows Netflix's expansion in original content.

1. The attached wages.xlsx Download wages.xlsx dataset contains data on the hourly wage, age, and education of 80 workers at a single manufacturing firm. You are interested in whether age has a quadratic effect on predicted wages.

A. The scatter plot I made comparing hourly wage against age shows that it's a non-linear relationship.  Shown in the chart, wages tend to increase with age during early career and in mid-career, and it shows that the peak is around the middle age. Then for older workers it tends to be a decline.  This visual evidence shows that a linear model is not the best at capturing the relationship. For the regression results, this confirms this as well. In the linear model,  age is not a statistically significant predictor of wage because the p-value is .194 and that's above .05 and the model explains very little variation in wages with a R² of .02. For the quadric model this is the better option because it shows that both age and age squared a highly statistically significant with a p-value of <.001 so,  less than 05 and with a negative coefficient on age squared indicating decrease returns to age. The quadric model also provides a much better fit,  with an R² of .4005 and a lower residual standard error.

B. For the multiple regression model the results had education as a strong positive effect on wages for each additional year.  Education increases wages by about $1.44 per hour,  and this effect is highly statistically significant having a p-value of <.001. Age had a small positive coefficient(.047), but it is not statistically significant because of the p-value being .127, that tell us that controlling for education, age alone does not have a strong linear effect on wages. 

C. These results confirm that for part A, the relationship between age and wage is nonlinear, which means even after controlling for education, allowing age to enter quadratically improves the goodness of fit and reduces the unexplained variation.  So, this means the quadratic specification of age is preferred over the linear specification. 

D. I use the quadratic multiple regression model,  the predicted hourly wage for an individual with 16 years of education increases from age 30 to age 50, and then decreases by the age of 70. 

E. According to the model, the age at which someone with 16 years of education attains the highest wages is 50 years old. 


2. The AnnArbor.xlsx Download AnnArbor.xlsxfile contains data on a portion of the rental market in Ann Arbor, MI. The data includes the monthly rent, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the square footage of 40 rental properties. 

A. The plot of rent against bedrooms shows generally a positive linear relationship, with rent increasing as the number of bedrooms rises. The relationship between rent and bathrooms is mostly linear, though there's some scattering in rent values for higher numbers of bathrooms. The Relationship between rent and square footage is nonlinear,  with rent increasing at a decreasing rate, suggesting that a log transformation of square footage may better capture this relationship. 

B. When I estimate the multiple regression model with monthly rent as a dependent variable and long transformed square footage,  number of bedrooms,  and number of bathrooms  as explanatory variables.  Results was that square footage and bedrooms have a statistically significant positive effect on rent,  while the number bathrooms is not statistically significant.  This model showed the predicted monthly rent for a $1,600 ft rental with three bedrooms and two bathrooms is $1,540.
